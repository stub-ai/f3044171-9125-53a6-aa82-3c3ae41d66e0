The game deals 9 cards to each player, and players select a card and pass their hand until all cards are selected. The game ends when the last card is selected, and the deck needs to reset if the user wants to play all three rounds. The deck is a vector of Card objects, and the game has three players. The function should clear the existing deck, recreate it, and ensure it's ready for a new round.","md5":"03050037b6cfd70ad688da2ab93a68db"}]}
